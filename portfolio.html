        <p>This game focuses on catching apples with the use of a bowl. You gain points whenever you catch the apples and lose points whenever you do not
        catch an apple, elephant or a penguin.It's easy, gain a score of 200 points and you win! All of these objects appear at randoom from the top of 
        screen and travel down. The game starts off easy and all you are doing is catching apples up until 100 points, but after every 50 points new objects
        appear. Be careful not to touch the penguin or else it's all over. Failure to gain a score of higher than -10 also results in a loss.

          This game was inspired by Flappy Mario, a game that can be found on Scratch. Two major breakthroughs during this game development was the use of
          a more block and how to make the elephant move to a random position. However to get to the success of the elephant it took many trials and errors. 
          Along with this obstacle, we also faced confusion on how to use forever loops. The solution to these problems were to ask the teacher. If there 
          were more time and resources present, I would like to implement a pause button since it would allow people to rage and then come back down and 
          play the game again.

          This algorithm was used to control the apple and its random movement, it also has code so if it is caught or not to either gain or lost points. An
          algorithm similar to this also was used for the elephant and penguin.
